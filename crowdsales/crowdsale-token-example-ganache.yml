# This is an example for deploying a crowdsale compatible EIP-20 token on a private testnet.
#
# First start a transient local Ethereum chain using populus and geth:
#
#   populus chain run local
#
# This will start a private chain running geth in port 8548. The
# first launch might be slow as it has to generate 1 GB DAG file.
# Leave populus + geth running on the background.
#
# Then in another terminal you can run a command to deploy this token script:
#
# deploy-contracts --address=coinbase --deployment-file=crowdsales/crowdsale-token-example-ganache.yml --deployment-name=local-token
#
# This will deploy a new token using the default coinbase account
# on the local chain. Running the command takes ~60 seconds.
#
# You can find it your coinbase account (account 0) by doing:
#
#   geth attach http://localhost:8548
#
#   > eth.accounts
#   ["0xce90d9e5024e97f3123999aae6a1c395bb3c2013"]
#

# This is the deployment-name parameter.
# We can have multiple deployments in a single YAML file.
